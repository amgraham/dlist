dlist - simple directory listing
====

An empty folder presented by Apache (or others) is very ugly. Not anymore.

Installation
----

Place dir-listing.php anywhere accessible on your web-host of choice. It is recommended to place it somewhere generic, and then link it into other directories.

    cd /var/www/bin/
    ln -s ../assets/dir-listing.php ./index.php

Enhancement
----

It will look prettier if you also utilize four icons and a web-font, they are "turned off" by default so you can get up and running immediately, you should enable them though.

The four icons are from http://somerandomdude.com/work/iconic/ and included in this release for your convenience.

The font is Universalis from http://arkandis.tuxfamily.org/adffonts.html and included in this release for your convenience.
