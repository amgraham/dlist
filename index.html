        <h1>dlist - simple directory listing</h1>

<p>An empty folder presented by <a href="http://apache.org">Apache</a> (and others) is very ugly. <a href="https://github.com/amgraham/dlist">dlist</a> strives to replace the default in a less-ugly, and slightly-more-useful manner. </p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<p>dlist's goal is to match the feature set of Apache's default directory list, with a few enhancements (mostly style), in doing so, you can sort the files by the various columns. Clicking them again will reverse the order.</p>

<p>There is a <a href="http://smarterfish.com/assets/">demo available</a> that showcases the various features and design of dlist. Another <a href="http://craft.smarterfish.com/map/">demo is available</a> that showcases the <a href="#helper-files">details helper file</a> feature.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>You only <em>really</em> need <code>dir-listing.php</code>, <a href="https://raw.github.com/amgraham/dlist/master/dir-listing.php">grab the file</a>, make any <a href="#enhancement">adjustments</a> you might need to make, and place it somewhere accessible on your web-host of choice.</p>

<p>It is recommended to place it somewhere easy (read; universally accessible), and then link it into other directories. Keep in mind, any associated <a href="#helper-files">helper files</a> will need to go within the various directories that require them.</p>

<pre><code>cd /var/www/bin/
ln -s ../assets/dir-listing.php ./index.php
</code></pre>

<p>If you wanted to have a <code>.dir-list-details</code> file as well, it must be placed in the same directory.</p>

<pre><code>cd /var/www/bin/
cat &gt; .dir-list-details
&lt;p&gt;Hello there!&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I'm very aware that for multiple directories this is a chore, I'm <a href="https://github.com/amgraham/dlist/issues">open to suggestions</a> on how to alleviate the initial investment.</p>

<h2>Enhancement</h2>

<h3>General Prettiness</h3>

<p>It will look prettier if you also utilize four icons and a web-font, they are "turned off" by default so you can get up and running immediately.</p>

<p>The four icons are from <a href="http://somerandomdude.com/work/iconic/">http://somerandomdude.com/work/iconic/</a>, while the font is Universalis from <a href="http://arkandis.tuxfamily.org/adffonts.html">http://arkandis.tuxfamily.org/adffonts.html</a> both are included in this release for your convenience.</p>

<p>If you decide to beautify your version upload the four icons and web font somewhere easy (read; universally accessible), open <code>dir-listing.php</code> in your favorite editor, and change <code>$pretty</code> to <code>true</code> then update <code>$imgdir</code> &amp; <code>$fontdir</code> accordingly (wherever you decided to keep the icons and webfont).</p>

<p>A refresh of your browser should display the changes.</p>

<h3>Hidden Files</h3>

<p>By default, dlist will not display hidden files (some call them "dot-files") within the current directory; this is intentional and recommended.</p>

<p>You can override the default and change <code>$showhidden</code> to <code>true</code> and have dlist make your hidden files available for all the world to see. <strong>This is not recommended.</strong> If you follow the recomendation or not, dlist will not show it's <a href="#helper-files">helper files</a>.</p>

<h2>Helper Files</h2>

<p>Currently there is one helper file in use: <code>.dir-list-details</code>. It will take whatever is contained in the file <code>.dir-list-details</code> from the same directory being displyed and insert it at the top of the current directory listing. There is a <a href="http://craft.smarterfish.com/map/">demo displaying this in action</a>.</p>

<p>There is no processing for security, the text contained within <code>.dir-list-details</code> is passed directly to the browser.</p>

<h2>Future</h2>

<ol>
<li>Count of items in a folder (not sure about this one; feedback welcome)</li>
<li>Add another "helper file" to force a specific folder/file to be hidden regardless of the specific setting</li>
</ol>
